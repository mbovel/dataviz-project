# Team

We're a team of 3 students at [Ecole Polytechnique F&eacute;d&eacute;rale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/home/) in Lausanne, Switzerland. We all love data and dataviz, but we also each have our own unique perks -- read more about them below.

I am studying an MSc in Data Science and I am on track to graduate in July 2020. My interests are diverse, encompassing statistics, computer science, social work, global development, and engineering, including a BS in Mechanical Engineering from [The University of Texas at Austin (USA)](https://www.utexas.edu/). My passion is merging the domains of artificial intelligence, data science, social science, and public policy to learn more about the world and help people who need it most.

After hesitating for a long time between becoming a professional trapeze artist or a software engineer, I chose the latter and I'm now pursing a Masters Degree in Computer Science at EPFL. In my studies, I'm mainly interested in programming languages, web technologies and data analysis.

## Ruslan Aydarkhanov

A PhD candidate in the field of Brain-Computer Interaction. Being torn between my interests in computer science and biology, I have never made a choice. My PhD project is focused on interpreting electrical signals from human brain, which will allow direct user communication with machines in the future.
